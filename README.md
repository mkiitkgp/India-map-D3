India-map-D3
============

India map of district level using D3.js

In the data folder we have full_data-1.json file which contains the coordinates of the state and the districts of the
India. Using that data and using D3.js ( "http://d3js.org/" ) we can able to plot the map having all the districts. On 
hovering it will give the district name and the state corresponding to that district.




Using this map you can also change the color of the district based on any parameter eg. employment rate
but to show that you need a json/csv/ files having district name and the parameter values.
